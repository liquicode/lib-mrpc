# lib-mrpc

A transport agnostic message based remote procedure call library designed to facilitate the
evolution and scalability of complex systems.

## Overview

This library allows you to define a number of specific commands (`Endpoints`) that can be
invoked, regardless of location, using a transport abstraction (`ServiceProvider`).
An `Endpoint` represents a function that does specific work for an application.
